#+TITLE: POC: Dockerized CLI with input redirection
#+AUTHOR: 64J0

This repository contains the code for a proof of concept (POC) demonstrating how
input redirection can be used to provide data to a Dockerized CLI
application. The application, developed in F#, sums all numbers passed through
STDIN after converting them to their integer representations.

+ Check this article from my personal blog for more details: [[https://gaio.dev/posts/2024-11-22-dockerized-cli-with-input-redirection][link]].

** How to run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :tangle no
  # run the program using "normal" base image
  make run

  # run the program using the chiseled base image
  make run-chiseled
#+END_SRC
